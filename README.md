This repo contains custom airports for Endless ATC. To use them just add them to the locations directory in the game folder.

Please use the version without _COMMENTS.txt as that one will work exactly as it should in the game. Version with comments should be for reference only.

        - Note on something to be fixed: SBNF CTR area is incorrect. As far as my research goes, there is no available official waypoint demarcation of the area online. In the sources there's one, but it is wrong. To fix this, one would've to trace it manually using a chart that contains it. I intend to do this in the future or to fix it with the correct waypoints if the material becomes available. This has no to very minimal gameplay effect so it is not a priority.
